<p>Description Of the Book</p>
<p><b><i>In the multiplayer online game Glory, Ye Xiu is regarded as a textbook and 
    a top-tier pro-player. However, due to a myriad of reasons, he is kicked from the team.
     After leaving the pro scene, he finds work in an Internet Cafe as a manager.
      When Glory launches its tenth server, he throws himself in to the game once more. 
      Possessing ten years of experience, the memories of his past, and an incomplete,
     self-made weapon, his return along the road to the summit begins! </b></i> </p>
