    <p>A boy raised by boars, who wears a boar's head, boards the Infinity Train on a new mission with the Flame Pillar along with another boy who reveals his true power when he sleeps. Their mission is to defeat a demon who has been tormenting people and killing the demon slayers who oppose it..The final climactic battle of "Mugen Train" pits the Flame Hashira Rengoku against a powerful demon named Akaza. 
        After the destruction of Enmu and the Mugen Train, Rengoku and the three younger demon slayers think the battle is finally over and are confused as to why an Upper Rank demon is there. And while we've seen Hashira-level demon slayers in action at various points in the first season, what ensues in the Rengoku vs. Akaza battle is an explosive, fiery nail-biter unlike anything glimpsed thus far in the animated franchise.
